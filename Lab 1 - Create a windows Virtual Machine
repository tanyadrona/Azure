üñ•Ô∏è Create a Windows Virtual Machine in Azure
üìò Overview

This guide walks you through the process of creating a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure using the Azure portal. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a running Windows VM that you can connect to via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

2. Create a Resource Group

In the left-hand menu, select Resource groups. Click on + Create. Fill in the following details:

Subscription: Choose your subscription.

Resource Group: Enter a name for your resource group (e.g., RG-VM-Training).

Region: Select a region close to your location.

Click Review + Create, then click Create.

3. Create a Virtual Machine

In the left-hand menu, select Virtual machines.

Click on + Create, then select Azure virtual machine.

In the Basics tab, fill in the following details:

Subscription: Choose your subscription.

Resource Group: Select the resource group you created earlier.

Virtual Machine Name: Enter a name for your VM (e.g., VM-Training).

Region: Select the same region as your resource group.

Availability Options: Select No infrastructure redundancy required.

Image: Select Windows Server 2019 Datacenter.

Size: Choose a size (e.g., Standard_B1s).

Authentication Type: Select Password.

Username: Enter a username (e.g., azureuser).

Password: Enter a strong password and confirm it.

Click Next: Disks.

4. Configure Disks

In the Disks tab, you can leave the default settings:

OS Disk Type: Select Standard SSD.

Encryption Type: Select Encryption at rest with a platform-managed key.

Click Next: Networking.

5. Configure Networking

In the Networking tab, configure the following:

Virtual Network: Select Create new and enter a name (e.g., VNet-VM-Training).

Subnet: Select Create new and enter a name (e.g., Subnet-VM-Training).

Public IP: Select Create new and enter a name (e.g., PublicIP-VM-Training).

NIC Network Security Group: Select Basic.

Public inbound ports: Select Allow selected ports.

Select inbound ports: Choose RDP (3389).

Click Next: Management.

6. Configure Management

In the Management tab, you can leave the default settings:

Monitoring: Select On for Boot diagnostics.

The deployment may take a few minutes. Once completed, you'll see a notification indicating the deployment has succeeded.

10. Connect to the Virtual Machine

In the Azure portal, navigate to Virtual machines.

Select the VM you just created.

In the Overview section, click on Connect, then select RDP.

Download the RDP file and open it.

Enter the username and password you set earlier to log in.

üßπ Clean Up Resources

After you're done, it's a good practice to delete the resources to avoid unnecessary charges:

In the Azure portal, navigate to Resource groups.
