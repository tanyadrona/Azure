Virtual Machines (VMs)

Definition: A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer running in the cloud, just like a physical computer.

Uses:

Hosting applications or websites.

Testing and development.

Running software that requires Windows/Linux environments.

Key Concepts:

VM Size: Defines CPU, memory, and disk capabilities. Example: B1s (small, low-cost).

OS Image: Pre-configured operating system like Windows Server 2019 or Ubuntu Linux.

Networking: Each VM needs a Virtual Network (VNet), Subnet, and optionally a Public IP to communicate.

Authentication: Username/password or SSH keys to securely connect.

Availability Options: Determine how the VM handles downtime or failures.

Disks: VMs have OS disks and optionally data disks for storage.

#Deployment Steps (Summary)

Create a Resource Group → acts as a container for your VM.

Create a Virtual Machine → choose size, OS image, authentication, and region.

Configure Networking → assign VNet, Subnet, Public IP, and open required ports (e.g., RDP 3389 for Windows).

Connect to VM → use RDP for Windows or SSH for Linux.

Clean Up → delete the Resource Group to remove all resources and avoid unnecessary costs.
