Azure Hierarchy & Resource Organization

Azure organizes resources in a hierarchical structure:

Management Groups – Top-level containers for multiple subscriptions; used mainly in large enterprises for governance and policy enforcement.

Subscriptions – A billing and administrative boundary. Every resource in Azure belongs to a subscription.

Resource Groups (RGs) – Containers that hold related Azure resources (VMs, Storage Accounts, Networks, etc.).

Makes management, monitoring, and deletion easier.

Example: All resources for a web application can belong to a single RG.

Resources – Actual services like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, Databases, Virtual Networks, etc.

Hierarchy:
Management Group → Subscription → Resource Group → Resource
